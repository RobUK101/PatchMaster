PatchMaster is an end-to-end automation solution for the creation of patch payloads and delivery using WSUS, SCCM and Windows clients.

Please visit the TechNet Gallery for detailed information on tool usage [TechNet Gallery PatchMaster](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/PatchMaster-51716e13)

There is also an (out of date, applicable to V1.3, still relevant) guide on my personal blog [How to use PatchMaster](http://configmgr2012.com/patchmaster-v1-3-guide/)

Built upon .Net 4.5 and written using C#, this tools purpose is to reduce custom scripting to achieve automation of patch delivery. A human is still required to interact but the tool can be scheduled to run using Scheduled Tasks and can be run hourly, daily, weekly or monthly to suit your requirements.

This tool is non-commercial, no cost, it is freeware, there are no restrictions on its usage (hence why it is called FREEWARE). All I ask is if you use this source code, to give me a shout on twitter @RobMVP, as it makes my day to know someone has benefited from my efforts!
